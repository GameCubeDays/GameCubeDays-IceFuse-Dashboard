# This controls WHEN the automation runs
on:
  # This runs it on a schedule: '0 * * * *' means "at minute 0 of every hour"
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'
  
  # This also adds a "Run workflow" button to the Actions tab so you can test it

    # These are the steps it will take, in order
    steps:
      # 1. It checks out a copy of your repository's code
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. It installs Python
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11' # Make sure this matches your Python version

      # 3. It installs all the packages from your requirements.txt file
      - name: Install dependencies
        working-directory: ./GameCubeDays-IceFuse-Dashboard # <-- ADDED THIS
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install -e .

      # 4. This is a magic step: It takes the secret text you saved
      #    and creates the real 'google_sheets_service_account.json' file
      #    so your script can find it.
      - name: Create Google Sheets Credentials
        working-directory: ./GameCubeDays-IceFuse-Dashboard # <-- ADDED THIS
        run: echo "${{ secrets.GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY }}" > google_sheets_service_account.json

      # 5. It runs your main script. Notice how it feeds your other secrets
      #    into the script as environment variables.
      - name: Run data pipeline
        working-directory: ./GameCubeDays-IceFuse-Dashboard # <-- ADDED THIS
        run: python main.py

          STEAM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.STEAM_API_KEY }}

      # 6. Finally, it takes the 'graphs' folder that main.py just created
      #    and "deploys" it to a special branch called 'gh-pages'
      #    This branch will be our website.
